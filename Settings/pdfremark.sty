%% This is just a summary snippet of what I (Jürgen Spitzmüller
%% <j.spitzmueller@gmx.de>) have found in the newsgroups
%% about inserting annotations into pdf files.
%% You probably need pdftex >= v. 0.14 to get this work, older versions
%% have not been tested.
%%
%% Credits go to the people I have taken the code from, especially 
%% Carsten Zerbst (cf.
%% http://groups.google.de/group/de.comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/f761a21ddda537d5
%% and Heiko Oberdiek (many posts on the topic)
%%
%% usage \pdfremark[Remark Title]{Remark Text}
%% line breaks can be inserted with \\.
