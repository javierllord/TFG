abstract = {Traditional password based authentication has been proven inadequate and the use of biometrics have provided multiple solutions through the past years. One of the most recent approaches to biometric authentication is using Electrocardiograms (ECG), as they are closely related to unique characteristics of the heart of each person. In this paper a framework for efficient and usable user authentication, based on ECG, is proposed. The ECG is pre-processed in order to remove any noise or distortions and then multiple set of features are extracted from it, through various transformations. These set of features are used as input to classification models and the results are compared in order to find the most effective transformation-classifier combination, which also sets a performance baseline. Additionally Deep Learning Neural Networks are used in order to create classification models that predicts whether an ECG belongs to a specific person or not, based on the combination of the feature sets produced in the transformation step. The results obtained have shown that deep learning neural networks can provide higher accuracy in comparison to most of other techniques used, if there are enough data to train them on.},

In addition, deep learning is a fast-paced research field where several models, training schemes and applications are being actively investigated. In this paper, an ECG-based biometric system using a deep autoencoder to learn a lower dimensional representation of heartbeat templates is proposed. A superior identification performance is achieved, validating the expressiveness of such representation. A transfer learning setting is also explored and results show practically no loss of performance, suggesting that these deep learning methods can be deployed in systems with offline training.},

abstract = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an emerging biometric modality that has seen about 13 years of development in peer-reviewed literature, and as such deserves a systematic review and discussion of the associated methods and findings. In this paper, we review most of the techniques that have been applied to the use of the electrocardiogram for biometric recognition. In particular, we categorize the methodologies based on the features and the classification schemes. Finally, a comparative analysis of the authentication performance of a few of the ECG biometric systems is presented, using our inhouse database. The comparative study includes the cases where training and testing data come from the same and different sessions (days). The authentication results show that most of the algorithms that have been proposed for ECG-based biometrics perform well when the training and testing data come from the same session. However, when training and testing data come from different sessions, a performance degradation occurs. Multiple training sessions were incorporated to diminish the loss in performance. That notwithstanding, only a few of the proposed ECG recognition algorithms appear to be able to support performance improvement due to multiple training sessions. Only three of these algorithms produced equal error rates (EERs) in the single digits, including an EER of 5.5{\%} using a method proposed by us. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Studies conducted in the past included different types of regular biometric traits, namely fingerprint, face, iris, and voice have a limitation of falsification, and they do not fit guarantee of liveness of the subject. In this context, Electrocardiogram based Biometric recognition is an alternative solution, where the security of the information is very high level. This research aims to provide with a complete systematic approach to ECG based Biometric recognition, which contains primarily the processing of raw signal through noise elimination filters and a time domain analysis is carried for all ECG characteristic waves detection. Subsequently, an effective feature extraction method for ECG is developed, which extracts six best P-QRS-T fragments based on priority and their positions are normalized. Also, 72-time domain features are calculated. These features are formed into feature vector corresponding to each signal separately for both train and test data sets. To analyze the performance of the system, the feature vectors are trained with various Machine learning classification algorithms like Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Finally, the proposed system is tested with a challenging, public available MIT-BIH ECG-ID Database. A comparative analysis using performance parameters is made with different classifiers, and the obtained results show that SVM classifier provides 93.709{\%} overall classification accuracy when compared to previous literature.},

Most applications lie in the field of diagnosis of heart attacks, as regards the ECG, or the detection of epileptic events, in the case of the EEG. In the last ten years, these signals are being investigated also from a biometric point of view, in order to exploit the discriminative capability provided by these measures in recognizing individuals. The present work proposes a multimodal biometric recognition system based on the fusion of the first lead (i) of the electrocardiogram (ECG) with six different bands of the electroencephalogram (EEG). The proposed approach is based on the extraction of fiducial features (peaks) from the ECG combined with spectrum features of the EEG. A dataset has been created, by composing the signals of two well-known databases. The results, reported by means of EER values, AUC values and ROC curves, show good recognition performances.},

abstract = {A biometric system performs template matching of acquired biometric data against template biometric data [17.1]. These biometric data can be acquired from several sources like deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ear, face, facial thermogram, fingerprints, gait, hand geometry, hand veins, iris, keystroke, odor, palm print, retina, signature, voice, etc. According to previous research, DNA, iris and odor provide high measurement for biometric identifiers including universalities, distinctiveness and performance [17.1]. DNA provides a one dimensional ultimate unique code for accurate identification for a person, except for the case of identical twins. In biological terms “Central Dogma” refers to the basic concept that, in nature, genetic information generally flows from the DNA to RNA (ribonucleic acid) to protein. Eventually protein is responsible for the uniqueness provided by other biometric data (finger print, iris, face, retina, etc.). Therefore, it can be inferred that the uniqueness provided by the existing biometric entities is inherited from the uniqueness of DNA. It is imperative to note that shape of the hand or palm print or face or even the shape of particular organs like the heart has distinctive features which can be useful for successful identification. The composition, mechanism and electrical activity of the human heart inherit uniqueness from the individuality of DNA. An electrocardiogram (ECG) represents the electrical activities of the heart. Figure 17.1 shows the inheritance of uniqueness for ECG inherited from the DNA.},

Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Haar transform features were extracted and fed to decision methods based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and Gaussian Mixture Models - Universal Background Models (GMM-UBM) classifiers, for both identification and authentication tasks. Additional techniques of user-tuned authentication and past score weighting were also studied. The method's performance was comparable to some of the best recent state-of-the-art methods (94.9{\%} identification rate (IDR) and 2.66{\%} authentication equal error rate (EER)), despite lesser results with scarce train data (70.9{\%} IDR and 11.8{\%} EER).

The proposed framework can help investigators and developers on ECG-based biometric authentication mechanisms define the boundaries of required datasets and get training data with good quality. To determine the boundaries of datasets, use case analysis is adopted. Based on various application scenarios on ECG-based authentication, three distinct use cases (or authentication categories) are developed. With more qualified training data given to corresponding machine learning schemes, the precision on ML-based ECG biometric authentication mechanisms are increased in consequence. The ECG time slicing technique with the R-peak anchoring is utilized in this framework to acquire ML training data with good quality. In the proposed framework four new measure metrics are introduced to evaluate the quality of the ML training and testing data. In addition, a Matlab toolbox, containing all proposed mechanisms, metrics, and sample data with demonstrations using various ML techniques, is developed and made publicly available for further investigation. For developing ML-based ECG biometric authentication, the proposed framework can guide researchers to prepare the proper ML setups and the ML training datasets along with three identified user case scenarios. For researchers adopting ML techniques to design new schemes in other research domains, the proposed framework is still useful for generating the ML-based training and testing datasets with good quality and utilizing new measure metrics.},

abstract = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive test that records the electrical activity of the heart and is important in the investigation of cardiac abnormalities. Each portion of the ECG waveform carries various types of information for the cardiologists analyzing patient's heart condition. ECG interpretation at the present time remains dependent manually in time domain. It is difficult for the cardiologists to make a correct diagnosis of cardiac disorder. A computerized interpretation of ECG is needed in order to make the diagnosis more efficient. This paper discusses the use of digital signal processing approach for the detection of heart blocks in ECG signals. Signal analysis techniques such as the periodogram power spectrum and spectrogram time-frequency analysis are employed to analyze ECG variations. Seven subjects are identified: normal, first degree heart block, second degree heart block type I, second degree heart block type II, Third degree heart block, right bundle branch block and left bundle branch block. Analysis results revealed that normal ECG subject is able to maintain higher peak frequency range (8 Hz), while heart block subjects revealed a significant low peak frequency range ({\textless} 4 Hz). The results revealed that the periodogram power spectrum can be used to differentiate between normal and heart block subjects, while the spectogram time-frequency analysis is used to give better characterization of ECG parameters. These analyses can be used to construct ECG monitoring and analyzing system for heart blocks detection. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

Their validation on 10, 20,{\ldots} 230 reference subjects (RS) from the remaining 230 ECG pairs shows: (i) two best single-lead ID models using lead II for a small population RS = (10–140) with identification accuracy AccID = (89.4–67.2){\%} and aVF for a large population RS = (140–230) with AccID = (67.2–63.9){\%}; (ii) better performance of the 6-lead limb vs. The 6-lead chest ID model—(91.4–76.1){\%} vs. (90.9–70){\%} for RS = (10–230); (iii) best performance of the 12-lead ID model—(98.4–87.4){\%} for RS = (10–230). The tolerable reference database size, keeping AccID {\textgreater} 80{\%}, is RS = 30 in the single-lead ID scenario (II); RS = 50 (6 chest leads); RS = 100 (6 limb leads), RS {\textgreater} 230—maximal population in this study (12-lead ECG).},

We explore a novel biometric based on the electrical activity of the human heart in the form of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. In order to explore the stability of ECG as a biometric, we collect data from 55 participants over two sessions with a period of 4 months in between. We also use a consumer-grade ECG monitor that is more affordable and usable than a medical-grade counterpart. Using a standard approach to evaluate our classifier, we obtain error rates of 2.4{\%} for data collected within one session and 9.7{\%} for data collected across two sessions. The experimental results suggest that ECG signals collected using a consumer-grade monitor can be successfully used for user authentication.},

abstract = {Traditional mobile login methods, like numerical or graphical passwords, are vulnerable to passive attacks. It is common for intruders to gain access to personal information of their victims by watching them enter their passwords into their mobile screens from a close proximity. With this in mind, a mobile biometric authentication algorithm based on electrocardiogram (ECG) is proposed. With this algorithm, the user will only need to touch two ECG electrodes (lead I) of the mobile device to gain access. The algorithm was tested with a cell phone case heart monitor in a controlled laboratory experiment at different times and conditions with ten subjects and also with 73 records obtained from the Physionet database. The obtained results reveal that our algorithm has 1.41{\%} false acceptance rate and 81.82{\%} true acceptance rate with 4 s of signal acquisition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach on mobile authentication that uses ECG biometric signals and it shows a promising future for this technology. Nonetheless, further improvements are still needed to optimize accuracy while maintaining a short acquisition time for authentication.},

Given the vital and continuous nature of this information source, ECG signals offer several advantages to the field of biometrics; yet, several challenges currently prevent the ECG from being adopted as a biometric modality in operational settings. These arise partially due to ECG signal's clinical tradition and intru-siveness, but also from the lack of evidence on the permanence of the ECG templates over time. The problem of in-trusiveness has been recently overcome with the 'off-the-person' approach for capturing ECG signals. In this paper we provide an evaluation of the permanence of ECG signals collected at the fingers, with respect to the biometric authentication performance. Our experimental results on a small dataset suggest that further research is necessary to account for and understand sources of variability found in some subjects. Despite these limitations, 'off-the-person' ECG appears to be a viable trait for multi-biometric or standalone biometrics, low user throughput, real-world scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Baseline wander is a low-frequency noise of around 0.5 to 0.6 Hz. To remove it, a high-pass filter of cutoff frequency 0.5 to 0.6 Hz can be used. Powerline interference (50 or 60 Hz noise from mains supply) can be removed by using a notch filter of 50 or 60 Hz cutoff frequency. EMG noise is a high frequency noise of above 100 Hz and hence may be removed by a low-pass filter of an appropriate cutoff frequency. Electrode motion artifacts can be suppressed by minimizing the movements made by the subject. The chapter introduces the types of common noise sources in ECG signals and simple signal processing techniques for removing them, and also presents a section of Matlab code for the techniques described.},

Specifically, to achieve a super wearability, we suggest situating all the ECG electrodes on the left upper-arm, or behind the ears, and successfully obtain weak but distinguishable ECG waveforms. Afterwards, to identify individuals from weak ECG, we further present a two-stage framework, including ECG imaging and deep feature learning/identification. In the former stage, the ECG heartbeats are projected to a 2D state space, to reveal heartbeats' trajectory behaviors and produce 2D images by a split-then-hit method. In the second stage, a convolutional neural network is introduced to automatically learn the intricate patterns directly from the ECG image representations without heavy feature engineering, and then perform user identification. Experimental results on two acquired datasets using our wearable prototype, show a promising identification rate of 98.4{\%} (single-arm-ECG) and 91.1{\%} (ear-ECG), respectively.

abstract = {Body area networks, including smart sensors, are widely reshaping health applications in the new era of smart cities. To meet increasing security and privacy requirements, physiological signal-based biometric human identification is gaining tremendous attention. This paper focuses on two major impediments: the signal processing technique is usually both complicated and data-dependent and the feature engineering is time-consuming and can fit only specific datasets. To enable a data-independent and highly generalizable signal processing and feature learning process, a novel wavelet domain multiresolution convolutional neural network is proposed. Specifically, it allows for blindly selecting a physiological signal segment for identification purpose, avoiding the complicated signal fiducial characteristics extraction process. To enrich the data representation, the random chosen signal segment is then transformed to the wavelet domain, where multiresolution time-frequency representation is achieved. An auto-correlation operation is applied to the transformed data to remove the phase difference as the result of the blind segmentation operation. Afterward, a multiresolution 1-D-convolutional neural network (1-D-CNN) is introduced to automatically learn the intrinsic hierarchical features from the wavelet domain raw data without data-dependent and heavy feature engineering, and perform the user identification task. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is thoroughly evaluated on eight electrocardiogram datasets with diverse behaviors, such as with or without severe heart diseases, and with different sensor placement methods. Our evaluation is much more extensive than the state-of-the-art works, and an average identification rate of 93.5{\%} is achieved. The proposed multiresolution 1-D-CNN algorithm can effectively identify human subjects, even from randomly selected signal segments and without heavy feature engineering. This paper is expected to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of applying the blind signal processing and deep learning techniques to biometric human identification, to enable a low algorithm engineering effort and also a high generalization ability.},

abstract = {Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals have been successfully used to perform biometric recognition in a wide range of applications. However, ECG-based biometric systems are usually less accurate than technologies based on other physiological traits. To increase their performance, it is necessary to study novel approaches. Deep learning methods, like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can automatically extract distinctive features, and have demonstrated their effectiveness for other biometric systems. In this paper, we present Deep-ECG, a CNN-based biometric approach for ECG signals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature that uses a CNN for ECG biometrics. Deep-ECG extracts significant features from one or more leads using a deep CNN and compares biometric templates by computing simple and fast distance functions, obtaining remarkable accuracy for identification, verification and periodic re-authentication. Furthermore, using a simple quantization procedure, Deep-ECG can obtain binary templates that can facilitate the use of ECG-based biometric systems in conjunction with cryptographic applications. We also propose a simple method to enlarge the training dataset of ECG samples, which can increase the performance of deep neural networks. We performed experiments on large sets of samples acquired in uncontrolled conditions, proving the accuracy and robustness ofDeep-ECG in non-ideal scenarios. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of Deep-ECG for the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database, obtaining identification accuracy better or comparable to the best performing methods in the literature, also for signals with different characteristics with respect to the ones used to train the CNN.},

abstract = {Conventional access control systems are typically based on a single time instant authentication. However, for high-security environments, continuous user verification is needed in order to robustly prevent fraudulent or unauthorized access. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an emerging biometric modality with the following characteristics: (i) it does not require liveliness verification, (ii) there is strong evidence that it contains sufficient discriminative information to allow the identification of individuals from a large population, (iii) it allows continuous user verification. Recently, a string matching approach for ECG-based biometrics, using the Ziv-Merhav (ZM) cross parsing, was proposed. Building on previous work, and exploiting tools from data compression, this paper goes one step further, proposing a method for ECG-based continuous authentication. An adaptive way of using the ZM cross parsing is introduced. The use of the Lloyd-Max quantization is also introduced to improve the results with the string matching approach for ECG-based biometrics. Results on one-lead ECG real data are presented, acquired during a concentration task, from 19 healthy individuals.},

abstract = {The present deliverable contains the documentation related to the use of the software functions developed to implement the di erent performance evaluation metrics described in D3.3. The functions have been implemented to be fully compatible with the BEAT platform so that they can be used within the nal outcome tool of the project in order to carry out practical performance evaluations. Each function is accompanied by a link to its speci c source code (in python). Therefore, this deliverable is fully practical and requires some programming background from the reader. The deliverable also represents a key contribution to the prototyping and development work to be carried out in WP7 where further documentation and manuals will be generated for the practical use, installation and deployment of the platform.},
